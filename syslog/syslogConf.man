NAME
     syslog.conf - configuration file for syslogd system log dae-
     mon

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/syslog.conf

DESCRIPTION
     The file /etc/syslog.conf contains information used  by  the
     system  log  daemon, syslogd(8), to forward a system message
     to appropriate log files and/or users.  syslog  preprocesses
     this  file  through m4(1V) to obtain the correct information
     for certain log files.

     A configuration  entry  is  composed  of  two  TAB-separated
     fields:

          _s_e_l_e_c_t_o_r       _a_c_t_i_o_n

     The _s_e_l_e_c_t_o_r field contains a  semicolon-separated  list  of
     priority specifications of the form:

          _f_a_c_i_l_i_t_y._l_e_v_e_l[;_f_a_c_i_l_i_t_y._l_e_v_e_l]

     where _f_a_c_i_l_i_t_y is a system facility, or comma-separated list
     of facilities, and _l_e_v_e_l is an indication of the severity of
     the condition being logged.  Recognized values for  _f_a_c_i_l_i_t_y
     include:

     user      Messages generated by user processes.  This is the
               default  priority  for  messages  from programs or
               facilities not listed in this file.

     kern      Messages generated by the kernel.

     mail      The mail system.

     daemon    System daemons, such as ftpd(8C), routed(8C), etc.

     auth      The  authorization   system:   login(1),   su(1V),
               getty(8), etc.

     lpr       The line printer spooling system: lpr(1),  lpc(8),
               lpd(8), etc.

     news      Reserved for the USENET network news system.

     uucp      Reserved  for  the  UUCP  system;  it   does   not
               currently use the syslog mechanism.

     cron      The cron/at facility; crontab(1), at(1),  cron(8),
               etc.

     local0-7  Reserved for local use.

     mark      For timestamp messages produced internally by sys-
               logd.

     *         An asterisk indicates all  facilities  except  for
               the mark facility.

     Recognized values for _l_e_v_e_l  are  (in  descending  order  of
     severity):

     emerg     For panic conditions that would normally be broad-
               cast to all users.

     alert     For conditions that should  be  corrected  immedi-
               ately, such as a corrupted system database.

     crit      For warnings about critical  conditions,  such  as
               hard device errors.

     err       For other errors.

     warning   For warning messages.

     notice    For conditions that are not error conditions,  but
               may require special handling.

     info      Informational messages.

     debug     For messages that  are  normally  used  only  when
               debugging a program.

     none      Do not send messages from the  indicated  _f_a_c_i_l_i_t_y
               to the selected file.  For example, a _s_e_l_e_c_t_o_r of
                    *.debug;mail.none

               will send all messages _e_x_c_e_p_t mail messages to the
               selected file.

     The _a_c_t_i_o_n field indicates where  to  forward  the  message.
     Values for this field can have one of four forms:

     o+  A filename, beginning with a leading slash,  which  indi-
        cates  that  messages specified by the _s_e_l_e_c_t_o_r are to be
        written to the specified file.  The file will  be  opened
        in append mode.

     o+  The name of a remote host, prefixed with an @,  as  with:
        @_s_e_r_v_e_r,  which  indicates that messages specified by the
        _s_e_l_e_c_t_o_r are to be forwarded to the syslogd on the  named
        host.

SYSLOG.CONF(5)            FILE FORMATS             SYSLOG.CONF(5)



     o+  A comma-separated list of usernames, which indicates that
        messages  specified  by the _s_e_l_e_c_t_o_r are to be written to
        the named users if they are logged in.

     o+  An asterisk, which indicates that messages  specified  by
        the _s_e_l_e_c_t_o_r are to be written to all logged-in users.

     Blank lines are ignored.  Lines for which the first  charac-
     ter is a `#' are treated as comments.

Sun386i DESCRIPTION
     The file is as described above,  except  that  there  is  an
     additional  valid  entry type, for translation.  A line con-
     taining the keyword "translate," if present,  specifies  how
     system  error  messages  are translated, suppressed, or for-
     warded to appropriate log files and/or users.

     A translation entry in the file is  composed  of  five  TAB-
     separated fields:

               _t_r_a_n_s_l_a_t_e _s_o_u_r_c_e    _f_a_c_i_l_i_t_y  _i_n_p_u_t     _o_u_t_p_u_t

     The _t_r_a_n_s_l_a_t_e field consists of the word  translate  and  is
     used to indicate that this is a translation entry.

     The _s_o_u_r_c_e field contains a comma separated list  of  source
     names.  Recognized sources are:

     klog      Messages placed in /dev/klog by the kernel.

     log       Messages placed in /dev/log  file  by  local  pro-
               grams.

     syslog    Messages placed in the internet socket by programs
               on other systems.

     *         An asterisk indicates all three sources (klog, log
               and syslog).

     The _f_a_c_i_l_i_t_y field contains a comma-separated list of facil-
     ities.

     The _i_n_p_u_t field is the name of the file used  to  map  error
     messages (in printf format strings) to numbers.  This number
     is used to locate a new string in the file specified in  the
     output  field.   The  format  of  both files is described in
     translate(5).

     The output file specified by the output field translates the
     numbers from the input file into the desired error messages,
     and also specifies the format to be used to output each mes-
     sage.

EXAMPLE
     With the following configuration file:
         *.notice;mail.info     /var/log/notice
         *.crit                 /var/log/critical
         kern,mark.debug        /dev/console
         kern.err               @server
         *.emerg                *
         *.alert                root,operator
         *.alert;auth.warning   /var/log/auth

     syslogd will log all mail system messages except debug  mes-
     sages  and all notice (or higher) messages into a file named
     /var/log/notice.   It  logs  all  critical   messages   into
     /var/log/critical,  and  all  kernel  messages and 20-minute
     marks onto the system console.

     Kernel messages of err (error) severity or higher  are  for-
     warded  to the machine named _s_e_r_v_e_r.  Emergency messages are
     forwarded to all users.  The users "root" and "operator" are
     informed  of  any  alert  messages.   All  messages from the
     authorization system of warning level or higher  are  logged
     in the file /var/log/auth.

FILES
     /etc/syslog.conf
